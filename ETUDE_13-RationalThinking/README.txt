********

For compile our program, type (g++ main.cpp Integer.cpp Rational.cpp -o out) in terminal.
And the main.cpp is for testing our program. You can type (./out) in terminal and to see the results.

********

In our program for the input of integer, if the data is negative, the input type should be string, if positive its type can be integer. For the Rational, the input type should be string.

For doing this etude's code, the two of us finished the code writing together and did the test together to help each other on debug. When we do the comments, we divided the work. Ella was mainly responsible for the integer part, and Elsie was mainly responsible for the rational part
