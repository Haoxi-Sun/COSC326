********

For this etude, we have identified the subject-verb object from Maori, where the subject comes last. And also this is not the case as the pronouns (the ’we’ part in the example) tell us who’s involved (the subject of the sentence). We test the subjects in code and then translate the different subjects into Maori based on the table given in the pdf. Then make different lists of verbs with different tenses. And translate the verbs to Maori.

********

For running the program, you can compile it as usual, like(javac LookWhoTalking.java). And then run it use (java LookWhotalking) and type what you want to translate from English to Maori. If you want to stop the program, you just need a blank line.
